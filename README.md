# STUDENT-RESULT-CHECKING-WEBSITE
My dynamic web Project


I built a java full stack web application like student login and results 
checking by using credentials website where student can login and check 
their results. Where the admin has the separate credentials to login and 
admin can add the student semester wise results. Where the student can be 
able to see the semester wise marks by using the login credentials
